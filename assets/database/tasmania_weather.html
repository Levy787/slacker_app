<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>Tasmania is quite well known for having changeable and unpredictable weather, especially on the western side of the state. It is the type of place where you get all four seasons in a day. It is a temperate climate which sits in the roaring 40&rsquo;s belt. Warm air near the equator rises and travels towards the south pole, at 40&deg; south that air will descend as a west to south-westerly wind with &lsquo;roaring&rsquo; speeds. This means Tasmania cops a lot of strong westerly winds all year round, worse in the winter months. The westerly wind coming from the Indian Ocean picks up a lot of water on its way, and when that wind hits the west coast, it can rain for days or weeks non-stop. Once that wind has passed over central Tasmania and gets to the East coast, its generally a lot weaker and drier. This means that even throughout the winter months, the Eastern side of Tasmania stays extremely dry, and with the shelter of Mount Wellington, the capital of Hobart is the second driest city in Australia.</p>

<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>The summer period is between December and February. In Hobart, the average maximum temperature is 22 &deg;C and in Launceston it is 24 &deg;C, with lower altitude regions of Tasmania commonly reaching 30-35 &deg;C. The latter part of summer will generally see the best weather, with warmer days and less wind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are planning a mission to the west or south-west coast of Tasmania, late January and early February will give you the best chance of good weather.</p>
<p>Tasmanian can get large bushfires every 2-3 years on average. The fires can hit any part of the state and spread quickly and easily. Significant areas in the west and east may be shut down through summer if there is a fire or if it is likely a fire will occur. If you are in an area surrounded by trees and mountains and you either hear reports of a fire or see smoke, get out while you can or find somewhere safe to assess the situation.</p>
<p>The East coast can get extremely hot with temperatures getting up to 40&deg; in extreme circumstances. With plenty of good freshwater water holes and sandy beaches, the East coast is perfect for heat waves.</p>
<p>The longest day in Tasmania is the 22<sup>nd</sup> of December, sun rising around 5:30am and setting around 9pm, it will generally stay light until 10:30pm on clear days.</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>Autumn runs from March through May and provides some of Tasmania&rsquo;s most comfortable highlining weather. With temperatures averaging 18&deg;C and winds generally weaker, with better sustained weather windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tasmania&rsquo;s Autumn is well known for its very still, clear, and brisk mornings, camping in mountainous areas can provide life changing sunrises and sunsets. There are plenty of opportunities to rig some of the exposed alpine lines while you are up there.</p>
<p>If you are in a high-altitude region be prepared for snow and cold weather snaps, it is quite common to get snow from mid-autumn onwards.</p>
<p>Winter weather patterns begin setting in towards the end of Autumn, bringing cold snaps and large weather fronts.</p>
<h3>Winter</h3>
<p>Winter can be a quite brutal, it runs from June through August and brings wet and windy days with plenty of storms and snow. The Western side of the state by far cops the worst of it. Luckily for Hobart, a lot of the westerly winds and rain will be soaked up by Mount Wellington, keeping Hobart relatively dry through winter.</p>
<p>The temperatures at the lower level often go down to 2-3&deg;C and have an average maximum of 12-14&deg;C. The highlands and alpine regions can get down to -5 and -10&deg;C, snow can sit for months. This creates very picturesque alpine areas and highlines. Getting a clear day to see the picturesque area is a different story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of the climbing community will generally go to the East coast over winter as it has the driest, warmest, and least amount of wind compared to all other regions.</p>
<p>The West and South West should not be attempted by inexperienced crews or people over this time. Icy mountains, exposed peaks, and isolated areas are the perfect conditions to get in trouble. If weather sets in and you get into trouble, rescue crews can take days to reach you.</p>
<p>The shortest day of the year is the 21<sup>st</sup> June with sunrise around 7:40am and sunset around 4:40pm, about 9 hours of daylight.</p>
<p>The latter part of winter is generally the coolest and wettest. The rain will quickly dry up at the end of winter leading into Spring.</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>Spring, from September to November can be cool and windy. The early part of spring is generally still very cold with lows of 5-6&deg;C and highs of 15-16&deg;C, the alpine areas will still see a lot of snow and wild conditions. This is where you are likely to get all four seasons in a day. It is still recommended you hold your south west alpine missions off until the latter part of spring.</p>
<p>When the weather begins to change from mid to late spring onwards, the air temp will warm quickly but the winds may stick around into the early summer.&nbsp;</p>
