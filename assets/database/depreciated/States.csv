1,1,Tasmania,One of Australias and maybe the worlds finest Highline location.,"Tasmania, or Tassie as most people call it is one of the world's truly great highlining locations. It is not known for its easy and user-friendly rigging, nor for its short approaches, Tassie is known for its untouched beauty and outrageous concentration of excellent highline missions, all so different and varied you could spend a lifetime there and never do them all.","The very reason Tassie remains a special place within so manys hearts, is precisely its untouched beauty. The first proper climb in australia by a white guy was recorded here, along with the first highline (The Totem Pole). Considering the quantity of adventures that have happened in Tasmania (it is also world renowned for bushwalking) and the lack of impact, it is important highliners continue this valuable tradition. ","Bolts are a loaded topic, and i’m not going to tell you not to place them, in many circumstances they are a welcome addition and can even aid in reducing an environmental footprint. With 1000’s of established climbing routes across the state, it is surprising how few bolts you can find. The ethic has, and will continue to be, minimal trace, many times this has inspired bold accents and wonderful artfulness from climbers in their route “creations”. We as highliners can surely agree that rigging is more of an art than an activity. If you cannot find a way to rig naturally, perhaps someone else can.
The same goes for other adventures and multi day trips, smaller teams leave less impact, it is recommended to have fewer than 8 people to a group in world heritage areas, and that all should carry a poop tube. ","Traditionally camping has been very easy across the state, however in recent years (due to an increase in tourists and #vanlife), many local secrets are getting shut down. Just about anywhere is ok to park up or pitch up for the night given that you’re out early and don’t make it look like you’ve been camping. If you know you’re in for a big mission make sure you have somewhere planned to spend a couple days resting. 
A Parks Pass is essential for many of the best adventures in the state and also affords you free camping on many of the best campsites in the world. With even a couple nights at some of these sites it more than pays for itself, especially when only one is required per car (technically I think one is required per person). Ben lomond, Honeycomb Caves, Chain of Lagoons, Friendly Beaches, Swan River Camping and Ted’s beach are all good examples of these sites.
Keep in mind that it is legal to camp in any state forrest, reserve or easement. Given the amount of logging that takes place across tassie it is surprisingly easy to search satellite images to find the nearest logging road. For places like the tasmanian peninsula any of the offshoot dirt roads a couple km before Fortescue bay are legal camping (If you are keen on the moai, candlestick, totem pole, cape pillar or cape raoul, this is very good camping beta)
At the beginning of many hikes in the north west, the car parks are a decent spot to crash the morning before or day after, rangers generally don’t mind as long as you move on. 
There are also a number of private paid campsites all over the island, these are generally expensive however some such as the Raoul Bay Retreat offer discounts for climbers and even a wood fired hot tub. Simplify searching “camping” or “campsite” in google maps can reveal paid and free sites just around the corner, do not underestimate how good google maps can be. If you want the best reception Telsta is the only option.","The Bureau of Meteorology website is generally quite reliable in Tasmania, especially the radar section to forecast when you might get stuck in rain.
Tasmania Can get quite cool and extremely windy through the winter period but can also reach up to 40 degrees in the summer. The average maximum temperature in January/February is 24 and the average maximum is about 10 in July.
The North West and West of Tasmania by far gets the most rain and is considered a lot wilder than the East. The East Coast has the most consistent weather in the winter months.
The weather in the South West is extremely unpredictable and can change in an instant. If you are planning a trip out there be prepared for any conditions whether it is summer or winter. It is not uncommon for snow in the summer on top of the peaks.","Tasmania is quite good for free or cheap showers and fresh water. There are many locations around the state when you can get water and If there is not, find a freshwater creek and get it from there. Most well-known beaches will have free showers but are generally cold and outdoor. There are some showers which are more private and warmer. Food is generally bought in the bigger cities as it gets expensive quick when you get into the smaller towns. It is best to only get stuff from the smaller towns to top up your supply. There is some bin diving in some of the cities and towns.","The fuel price around Tasmania can vary greatly and sometimes it is hard to work out why. It can be a certain amount in the city, 10c more expensive in a small town then 20c cheaper in an even smaller town. Generally, it is best to fill up in the major cities then if you come across on of these unicorns, get as much fuel from there as you can.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,"There are many swimming holes around Tasmania and some ‘Hot’ springs near Hobart. Unless you are Wim Hof it is them most enjoyable to swim in these through the summer, winter months it gets icy cold."
