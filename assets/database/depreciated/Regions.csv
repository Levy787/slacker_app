1,1,North West,NULL,"The landscape out here is what people travel the world to see. Make sure to allot some time to experience it. Weather windows greater than 4 days are very rare, sometimes only happening a handful of times a year, if you’re watching the forecast and it looks good, make sure you get yourself out there. Devils gullet is a good place to warm up to the creative natural rigging and climbing missions that tassie requires with generally better weather and a 15min approach from the car it can make a good first stop from the ferry. Mt Geryon and the other Cradle Mtn - Lake st Clair peaks are on the opposite end of the spectrum, these are the full blown expedition style trips that give a lifetime of memories. Also in this category but requiring no climbing are Frenchmans Cap and The Tyndalls.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
2,1,North East,NULL,"Typically, drier and with some of the most consistent weather in the state, Ben Lomond is the exception here. Inventively you will end up out at Whitewater Wall at some point in your stay or many of the other beautiful white sand beaches, the type that squeak underfoot. A good place to have a bit of a rest between missions, while still getting some highlining and climbing done.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
3,1,East,NULL,"The East cost of Tasmania has some of the States best weather year-round. It generally has less rain and wind in the winter months and more sunny days in the summer. There is an immense concentration of beautiful beaches and a lot of good surfing. The highlines on the east cost are mostly costal and most of them lye in the Freycinet area. Most lines in Freycinet have at least one star and there are many three-star lines. While most lines are short there is a lot of potential for some 100m+ lines. If you are only in Tasmania for a short while and want the most reliable area with lots to do and many great lines, the East Coast is your best bet.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
4,1,South East,NULL,"Besides Mt Wellington, a highly recommended way to spend a day, the south east is THE seastack waterside adventure playground. There’s so many sea stacks and chossy coastlines here that highlines will always remain unrigged. Some of tassies most iconic classic lines are on the Tasmanian peninsula, and with some stunning white sand beaches, its hard to avoid the lifestyle, play hard, rest hard.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
5,1,South West,NULL,"A uniquely tasmanian experience is the south west. Perhaps the most wild weather on the island these missions are split between either the world’s tallest trees or Australia’s most inaccessible mountains. The massive eucalypts are among the tallest trees we’ll ever see on earth, drier summers are leading to more wildfires, and it's expected that many of these giants will disappear within 5-10years. Some at over 90m tall, and only minutes from roads,  these are beautiful creatures that are not to be missed. The mountains on the other hand can require upwards of 2 days tourture to reach, some even take 2 weeks of soggy muddy bush bashing. If you’ve come for type 2-3 fun, this is it!",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
