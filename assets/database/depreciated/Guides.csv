1,1,Cataract Gorge,-41.446994,147.118169,NULL,Launceston is a city in the north of Tasmania and home to Cataract Gorge. The gorge is situated within walking distance from the City of Launceston. Launceston is one of Australia’s oldest cities and the first city to be lit by hydroelectricity. Cataract Gorge provided means to generate the hydroelectricity. The power station is now decommissioned and the once privately owned section of the land was sold back to the Tasmanian Government on the provision that it remain a free recreation space for the people of Tasmania.,"The gorge can be accessed from a range of entry points. The closest car park to the highlines is at the end of Basin Road. There is a huge paid car park between 8am - 6pm and free outside of these hours. Locate the ‘Alexander Suspension Bridge’ crossing the river, the highline is located just 30m upstream to this bridge. Anchor positions are obvious.",NULL,NULL,"Security had tipped us off that despite the car park gates being locked after hours, no fines or trouble will be issued for any campers who ‘forgot’ to get their vehicles out before the gate was locked. ",NULL,Walk the webbing from either side to the bridge and pass it along the suspension bridge. (Very easy),NULL,NULL,"24hr/ 7 days shower, toilet and change room facilities under the main cafe at the ducks reach gorge."
2,2,Ben Lomond,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Tassie’s, and potentially Australia’s premier crack climbing destination. It also happens to be a pretty good highline location. Please follow the strong ethic, NO BOLTS. There are currently hundreds of climbing routes and not a single bolt, I’m sure we as highliners can keep this going, especially considering the quantity of boulders and cracks. This is predominantly a summer crag but expect alpine conditions year round. In winter, snow is not just a possibility, in fact you will be hard pressed to find a day without it. To date two areas have been highlined at, Jacob’s Ladder and Frew’s Flutes. Both offer sweeping views and excellent direct height. Nothing has been attempted around the back of the plateau yet, there looks potential for many adventurous trips, climbing and choss guaranteed. ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
3,3,Whitewater Wall,NULL,NULL,NULL,"Tassies answer to the question “Where can I camp, highline, climb and swim all in one spot?”. Beautiful granite formations drop directly into the sea while orange, red and yellow lichen paint themselves onto the rounded boulders. On a typical day here you can expect sunshine, ambient waves and some creative rigging. Please do not place additional bolts without community consultation. This area has been a hub for climbing over the last 50 years and is rich with history and tradition. With hundreds of routes packed into such a small area it may be a surprise to see so few bolts. The ethics have been clear and should remain so for highlining. It is possible to rig just about anything here and with such a short walk in and stable weather there is no excuse not to take extra time to equalise a few more trees or carry a few more spansets for that boulder wrap. ","From the entrance of Freycinet National Park, take the signage towards the lighthouse on Cape Tourville Rd. About 500m before the lighthouse a small dirt road with large speed humps turns left with signs saying “4WD ONLY” and “Access to Bluestone Bay” Follow this track for 2.5km to Bluestone Bay taking the right turn to Whitewater Wall Campground just before the tack heads steeply downhill to the small bay. The 4WD track although bumpy can be navigated by 2WD easily ONLY if you have sufficient clearance. The first hump on the track is one of the biggest.","head north-east. Sorrel (30min from hobart) is the last major area where you can expect to buy cheap food or alcohol. Freycient is 1h 45min north of here. There are a couple taps in Coles Bay however these are from tank water and prone to runout, fill up as much water as you can in Sorrel. ",head south-east. As for the above directions Launceston is the last major town and all food/water must be bought from here. ,"The camping at Whitewater Wall is free however it is due to the generosity and hard work of climbers over many years, please respect this place and do not leave any food waste or rubbish in the bush. Take note of all signage and allow other campers a full night's rest especially when it is busy. ",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
4,3,The Underworld,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,Mobile phone signals are poor at best. Expect to receive some messages (The RHS of tipper dipper and back up the 4WD track are best) but do not rely on the ability to send anything out. ,NULL,Walk the webbing from the back of the gully to the mouth or use a couple throws of a tagline.,NULL,The Campsite has one long drop toilet. It is generally well kept but sometimes runs out of paper so don’t forget your own. There are a few camping benches for cooking on etc.,"Coles bay, Bicheno and Swansea all have IGA’s and petrol stations however expect the prices and range to leave something desired. "
