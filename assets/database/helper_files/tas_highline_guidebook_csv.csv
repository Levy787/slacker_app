,,,,,,,,Description,
,,,,,,,,,Launceston is a city in the north of Tasmania and home to Cataract Gorge. The gorge is situated within walking distance from the City of Launceston. Launceston is one of Australia’s oldest cities and the first city to be lit by hydroelectricity. Cataract Gorge provided means to generate the hydroelectricity. The power station is now decommissioned and the once privately owned section of the land was sold back to the Tasmanian Government on the provision that it remain a free recreation space for the people of Tasmania.

There is a huge paid car park between 8am - 6pm and free outside of these hours. Security had tipped us off that despite the car park gates being locked after hours, no fines or trouble will be issued for any campers who ‘forgot’ to get their vehicles out before the gate was locked. Locate the ‘Alexander Suspension Bridge’ crossing the river, the highline is located just 30m upstream to this bridge. Anchor positions are obvious."

,,,,,,,,Description,
,,,,,,,,,Easy rigging on this fully bolted highline with ease of line crossing by using the suspension bridge right next to this highline. Daniel brought sport climbing to Cataract Gorge in the 1980’s and has been a contributor to the climbing scene in the gorge for a number of years since the first bolted sport route. He opened the eyes to the potential for fun lines up previously unprotected aretes and blank faces. Now Daniel has also brought the first established highline to the gorge in 2015. This line is remarkably easy to rig and will become a highline that can be rigged on the regular by any slackers passing through.
,,,,,,,,Warning,
,,,,,,,,,As the line crosses about 1m overhead of one of the main gorge walking tracks on the east side it is advisable to ensure public safety is carefully considered whilst rigging and walking.

,,,,,,,,,"Edge protection is required for these blocks with a few sharp contours to protect. Both sides are reasonable dangerous to access and setup rigging. Also beware of loose rocks that could dislodge and trundle down the hill towards walkers and other user groups. Ensure care is taken to retain access to the gorge. Having both highlines rigged at once is magical. A line originally spotted and visioned by Daniel Hoi Shung Ng, he had mentioned it to the SHF team who subsequently came and located/ established the line. Daniel provided his Spider Silk webbing to rig the highline and Joseph sent it onsight. Daniel Hoi Shung Ng passed away in December of 2015 in a tragic accident and will be remembered greatly for his efforts in Hong Kong/ China and his contributions to establishing some of the most classic sport climbs in Cataract gorge. He will be forever remembered by this line above his good friend Bob’."

,,,,,,,,,"Tassie’s, and potentially Australia’s premier crack climbing destination. It also happens to be a pretty good highline location. Please follow the strong ethic, NO BOLTS. There are currently hundreds of climbing routes and not a single bolt, I’m sure we as highliners can keep this going, especially considering the quantity of boulders and cracks. This is predominantly a summer crag but expect alpine conditions year round. In winter, snow is not just a possibility, in fact you will be hard pressed to find a day without it. To date two areas have been highlined at, Jacob’s Ladder and Frew’s Flutes. Both offer sweeping views and excellent direct height. Nothing has been attempted around the back of the plateau yet, there looks potential for many adventurous trips, climbing and choss guaranteed."

,,,,,,,,,"Tassies answer to the question “Where can I camp, highline, climb and swim all in one spot?”. Beautiful granite formations drop directly into the sea while orange, red and yellow lichen paint themselves onto the rounded boulders. On a typical day here you can expect sunshine, ambient waves and some creative rigging. Please do not place additional bolts without community consultation. This area has been a hub for climbing over the last 50 years and is rich with history and tradition. With hundreds of routes packed into such a small area it may be a surprise to see so few bolts. The ethics have been clear and should remain so for highlining. It is possible to rig just about anything here and with such a short walk in and stable weather there is no excuse not to take extra time to equalise a few more trees or carry a few more spansets for that boulder wrap.

There are a couple taps in Coles Bay however these are from tank water and prone to runout, fill up as much water as you can in Sorrel. From Launceston head south-east. As for the above directions Launceston is the last major town and all food/water must be bought from here. Coles bay, Bicheno and Swansea all have IGA’s and petrol stations however expect the prices and range to leave something desired. From the entrance of Freycinet National Park, take the signage towards the lighthouse on Cape Tourville Rd. About 500m before the lighthouse a small dirt road with large speed humps turns left with signs saying “4WD ONLY” and “Access to Bluestone Bay” Follow this track for 2.5km to Bluestone Bay taking the right turn to Whitewater Wall Campground just before the tack heads steeply downhill to the small bay. The 4WD track although bumpy can be navigated by 2WD easily ONLY if you have sufficient clearance. The first hump on the track is one of the biggest.The camping at Whitewater Wall is free however it is due to the generosity and hard work of climbers over many years, please respect this place and do not leave any food waste or rubbish in the bush. Take note of all signage and allow other campers a full night's rest especially when it is busy. 
Mobile phone signals are poor at best. Expect to receive some messages (The RHS of tipper dipper and back up the 4WD track are best) but do not rely on the ability to send anything out. "

,,,,,,,,,"The Needle can be accessed by rock hopping up the Douglas River from the bridge at the highway and then ascending the Leeaberra Track to Nichols Cap or via the Leeaberra Track southwards from Thompsons Marshes (refer to Douglas-Apsley Map & Notes 2011, and the Parks & Wildlife Service website: www.parks.tas.gov.au). There are bush camping sites near Heritage Falls and Tevelein Falls, and outside the park there is commercial camping at Bicheno and at Lagoons Beach. National park fees apply and park passes can be purchased from the visitor centres in Bicheno and Freycinet, or from Service Tasmania shops state-wide. The fungal root-rot disease Phytophthora cinnamomi, is present in the southern parts of the park. This fungus is carried in soil and water and is easily transported on walking boots, tent pegs and by cars and other equipment. To prevent its spread, please stay on walking tracks where possible and only walk the Leeaberra Track from north to south to minimise the risk of the fungus being spread into the northern part of the park. The park is a fuel stove only area. It should be noted that a more direct access can be taken, if the property owner grants permission, via “The Douglas Camping Ground”. This method takes an old gently rising 4x4 track from the back of his property until it peters out and bush bashing and advanced navigation is required for the remaining 2km in order to join the Leeaberra Track. Contact Chris Wallace for a map of this track (very helpful!)
All water must be carried from the cars and assume an overnight mission is necessary. In summer the douglas river is fairly dry and cannot be relied upon for water."

To find the start scramble up into the large east notch and abseil 10-15m down the other side to a hanging belay on the spiky shrubs. P1 - climb the mossy wall up the easiest weakness, trending left and mounting a few tricky mantles. Follow the line of easiest weakness up the jam crack (passing old piton) and into difficult vegetated mantle. Build belay here. P2 - scramble up diagonal slope to the left (15m). P3 - Up the easy but barely secured boulders, belay from a large boulder and single bolt on the far side of the top. A 60m rope is enough to rap back down into the notch with (30mish)."

,,,,,,,,Approach,
,,,,,,,,,"1.5 Days in and out. Take the ferry across lake St Clair and follow the overland track north for a few km to reach the pine valley turn off. Walk to Pine Valley Hut and have lunch here. You now have two options. Option One
The recommended option. Split up the group and have one scramble up the south summit while the other hikes the majority of the gear up the north side. South summit
From Pine Valley take the Acropolis walking track north for about 700m (15min walk) keeping the river system on your right. When a long footbridge crosses the stream, turn left into the bush at a stone cairn, stepping over a fallen tree bordering the track. Follow the barely discernible footpad through the forest using yellow arrows and pink tape markers on the trees to guide you. The track is very overgrown although the bush is fairly open so walking isn’t too challenging. Navigation can be tricky however as long as the creek is always on the left and you are no more than 70m from it (sometimes very close also) you are going in the right direction. Continue winding your way up the stunning valley system passing the pantheon high on your left and eventually catching glimpses of Geryon on the right. The campsite is a small cleared area that should appear within a few minutes of the first Geryon sightings. It is a little dark and usually damp and can be confirmed by the faint hand carved sign that reads “Geryon Campsite”. Pink markers should lead west to the creek (40m away) and continue to a scree slope. It is highly recommended to take this 5min detour to view the opposite side of the valley in order to scope the approach scramble. From the Campsite: Scramble west up the long, steep scree slope, bashing through the occasional growth until you reach steep cliffs. Take the vague footpad ascending south along the exposed bush ledges to just below the ridgeline. A good quality bivy cave can be found here that sleeps two (a tarp would be required to block out driving rain and it is recommended to bring up water as the nearby drip systems cannot be guaranteed for any longer than two days after rainfall). Do not ascend too high, instead turn north and traverse the bushy ledge system under the south spur before dropping down into the notch behind the south summit. Follow the cairns that climb gradually around the west face before ascending a steep and challenging gully to the top (the climbing is a little tricky although rock quality is generally sound, it’s recommended to pass packs up though this section). 
Overall time from the campsite to the south summit is roughly 1.5hrs. North Summit
The larger group should now take as much food and un-necessary supplies off the south team as possible and take the Lake Elysia track north. After roughly 1km it begins to climb steeply up the back of the pantheon until arriving at the high altitude pristine lakes. There is good fairly sheltered camping here although it is recommended to push further along the track and camp closer to Geryon itself on the more exposed top camp. This is not really an official camp spot and due to its fragile alpine nature and difficulty in finding adequate ground to dig holes in, poop tube is a wise idea. 
Small tarns populate the plateau and as such water is never far away (please take care not to contaminate these sources and take water away from them before washing dishes etc)
Ground sheets are also a great idea due to the abrasive nature of the dolerite rock shelves. Option Two
If the party has strong adventure climbers the Geryon traverse is a reasonable option. It have been known to shut down grade 25 climbers before with high levels of wilderness experience. Although only graded 17, the rock is heavily fractured in places and any accidents are instantly extreme given the remoteness of the location. 
If this option is selected additional climbing gear is required. 
(It is worth consulting thesarvo https://bit.ly/38ureGt and/or printed guidebooks for additional information.)"

The foresight can be ascended via an easy grade 8 scramble, a small rack of nuts, a couple cams and a few long slings are ample protection. A rope stretching, overhanging 60m rap gets you into the notch from the north peak. "

,,,,,,,,,Easy rigging on this fully bolted highline with ease of line crossing by using the suspension bridge right next to this highline. Daniel brought sport climbing to Cataract Gorge in the 1980’s and has been a contributor to the climbing scene in the gorge for a number of years since the first bolted sport route. He opened the eyes to the potential for fun lines up previously unprotected aretes and blank faces. Now Daniel has also brought the first established highline to the gorge in 2015. This line is remarkably easy to rig and will become a highline that can be rigged on the regular by any slackers passing through.
,,,,,,,,Warning,
,,,,,,,,,As the line crosses about 1m overhead of one of the main gorge walking tracks on the east side it is advisable to ensure public safety is carefully considered whilst rigging and walking.
